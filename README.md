# US Route Mapping

<https://nallantli.github.io/US-Route-Mapping/>

Took data from a dataset of US roads, cities, and intersections and put it into a website. Works? Yes. Slow? Yes.

A* is surprisingly fast for having to search through 28k nodes.

Use WASD to move around and Q and E to zoom in and out.
